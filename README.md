[DANCEMUSIC WTF-300](http://dancemusic.wtf/) is a web based quiz game created for us to learn what the different electronic dance music styles sound like. Hopefully it will help us get a better vocabulary next time we're trying to describe that great track we heard the other night.<br>


#### üóÑÔ∏èDataset

Dancemusic.wtf uses 592 music tracks from 57 different subgenres in Electronic Dance Music. <br>The dataset is based upon [musicmap.info](https://www.musicmap.info/) and its public [YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvwUL1or_EKtt-qmt_ob2KA/playlists). Created by Kwinten Crauwels. 

> Musicmap attempts to provide the ultimate genealogy of popular music genres, including their relations and history. It is the result of more than **seven years of research** with over 200 listed sources and cross examination of many other visual genealogies. Its aim is to focus on the delicate balance between comprehensibility, accuracy and accessibility.


(I recommend you to visit musicmap.info if you want to dig deeper, or learn about other genres outside of the electronic dance music cluster. It is a gold mine!)


#### üñ•Ô∏è Support Devices

The web app is tested on `macOS` in `Chrome 68`, `Safari 11`, `Firefox 61` and on `iOS 11.4`.<br>
And should work wherever flexbox works and a youtube player can be embedded. <br>
Let me know if you have problems with any other devices or browsers.
